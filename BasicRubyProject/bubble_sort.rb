#bubble_sort(array)
#initialized a sorted variable to false
#Make a loop that loop until sorted is equal to true which mean all element are sorted
#update variable sorted to true which will pass after the loop is started and stop the loop at the beginning without needing to redo the loop
#do a loop that compare between the two side by side number and do that for each of the number of the list/array
#if the number of the left is lesser than the number on the right swap them otherwise don't
#Swap the value between each number until array is sorted
#Update sorted to false because if we entered the condition that mean not all number are sorted and we need to redo a loop to sort again
#return result
#Additional add number of iteration and edge cases
